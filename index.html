                    Welcome to my website!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Ashley Xu, and I am currently a second year Computer Science major at Northeastern University. My website is currently a work in progress, so there are some temporary gaps. I have plans to add images and more features to this website in the future. Specifically, I am planning to take my own pictures around Boston to add, but I'm waiting for it to start warming up a bit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not working on homework or working remotely for my internship, I enjoy watching shows on Netflix, listening to music, taking walks outside, going out to eat (I'm a foodie, although lately I have been cooking a lot myself to practice), and watching YouTube videos.
                </p>
                <p>My favorite show of all time is <i>Friends</i>. In terms of music, my favorite artist at the moment is Kendrick Lamar.</p>
                <p>I'm originally from Idaho, so when I'm in Boston, I love to take the opportunity to eat fresh seafood and authentic Asian food.</p>
                <p>I enjoy watching skincare, makeup, and stationery YouTube videos. I like to research skincare and makeup products to add to my skincare and makeup routines. I actually like taking notes for classes and trying to make my notes look neat and aesthetically pleasing. I get a lot of inspiration from the videos I find on YouTube, such as different styles of neat handwriting and good pens and highlighters.
